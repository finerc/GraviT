 * and descriptions of geometric objects in the scene. The components are loaded into a render dataset object. The config file that is read 
 * by this class also contains information on which renderer to use. Back end renderers such as Optix and Manta do the actual ray-geometry 
 * intersections. The configuration file loader also adapts to object types and uses the appropriate reader class to parse the geometric
 * input. The extension of the file name in the config file is used to select which geometry reader to use. For example an .obj file extension
 * would cause the gvt obj file reader to be used to parse that file.
